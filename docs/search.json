    "text": "A cyberdeck is a custom-built, portable computer, often combining a single-board computer (e.g., a Raspberry Pi), display, keyboard, battery, and peripherals (e.g., camera, speakers) into a single, purpose-driven unit. Cyberdecks are often inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics.\nIn this project, I will be creating my first version of a cyberdeck. This first version will not particularly be a complex one since its the first one. The aim here is “Be as simple as possible”.\nSince my first priority is simplicity, I will be skipping anything that require soldering, unless its absolutly necessary. I will be also settling for a straight forward case with an attempt to make it look cyberpunky."

It also contains dual micro HDMI and a USB-C power port and 40 pin GPIO header which I will be relocating in this Cyberdeck (See Assembly).\n\n\n\nBattery\nStarting with the power supply, depends on which battery you choose, you will have different configuration. In my case I chose the 5000 mAh PiSugar 2 plus battery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in the pictures above, this battery allows me to connect the PCB board directly on the Pi itself from below, and placing the battery on the PCB board stabilizing it with a magnet. However, I will be putting the battery itself next to the Raspberry Pi, rendering the magnets useless.\n\n\nDisplay\nFor the display I am using the Waveshare 5-inch DSI touch screen with 800 x 480 resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard\nI used the Rii X1 Mini Wireless Keyboard with a Touchpad.\n\n\nCase: 3D Printed\nHere you can find the STL files, feel free to use and modify them.\nObviously, as this is the first version and my first time doing such thing, the case is not the most fancy, it is a regular streight forward lame one with some flaws but it does the job! More sofisticated versions will be created in the future."
